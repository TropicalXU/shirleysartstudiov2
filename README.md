## Introduction
***
Shirley's Art Studio is an online gallery website with a built in online store which feature secure payments using Stripe. At Layerlabs I wanted to re-create a live art gallery, showcasing and displaying each of Shirley's art pieces. This was key to creating the look and feel of the website. We wanted to make sure the paintings brought out the color while the website theme remained clean. I implemented a responsive design, suitable for all devices as well as clear navigation tools, Search Engine Optimization and security features. With all of this implemented Shirley was thrilled with the end result. Having her own website to showcase and sell her artwork allows Shirley a platform to share her work beyond the gallery and reach even more enthusiastic art lovers who can now get in touch from anywhere in the world.

## Stripe Developer
***

Stripue Developer Tools were used within the store feature of the site to securely collect payment information from the buyer. This was achieved using Stripe's Card Payment Tools which were added to the Paintings mongoose model database. The owner of the website can recieve secure payouts directly to their bank account with each sale.
Payment and billing information is available for the owner to retrieve using their Stripe account so that shipments can take place.
